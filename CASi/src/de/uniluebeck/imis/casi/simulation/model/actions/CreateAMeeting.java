 *         This action class shall be used whenever an Agent schedules a meeting
 *         which has an fixed time (both start time and duration) and multiple
 *         attendees. It will create HaveAMeeting Actions in the attending
 *         Agents, including the creator. So this one is a very short action
 *         most of the time. As it is complicated to find a time slot which fits
 *         all agents, this action has exchangeable scheduling methods.

/**
 * The action comparator is able to compare two actions as needed for scheduling
 * e.g by the {@link DefaultActionScheduler}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>This comparator compares as described below:</strong><br>
 * <ol>
 * <li>compare deadlines, earliest deadline is lower
 * <li>if deadlines are equal and not null, compare the priorities, higher
 * priority results in a lower result
 * <li>if priorities are equal, compare the latest time when the actions could
 * be performed to finish before their deadline, lower latest time results in
 * lower result
 * <li>if no decision until here, compare start times. Actions without start
 * time are rated lower because they could be performed whenever we like to
 * perform them.<br>
 * Actions with an earlier earliest start time are rated lower because we are
 * able to start them earlier (Sounds logical eeh? :-) )
 * <li>if no decision we compare the priorities again as a last try.
 * <li>last but not least if we haven't found any differences until here, we
 * check if the actions are really equal to avoid rating them as equal if they
 * arn't because {@link TreeSet}s would forget one action.
 * <ol>
